**Stack**:
React
Ruby on Rails back-end
PostresSQL for DB management
Jest for Testing

**INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Clone Github Repo to local machine
2. Bundle install on directory
3. Run "rails s" in terminal or command line to spin up localhost:3000

**DEPENDENCIES**
These are also outlined in the gem file; however, here are the ones I added:
- Bootstrap for styling
- Faker for creating fake data
- React-Rails

**With more time, I would have:**

- Wrote tests would be written in Jest
- Integrated faker data into the app instead of
- Done some code refactoring.  For example, creating components of each area and properly managing the states across the app.
- Created a dropdown instead of a same filter for both areas.
